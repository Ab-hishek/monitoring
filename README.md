# OpenEBS Monitoring add-on

This repository contains monitoring-related (like Prometheus, grafana, etc,) artifacts like helm charts/ YAMLs. The goal of this repository is to provide an easy to setup monitoring stack for OpenEBS. 

This repository will aggregate all the monitoring related artifacts that are currently spread across multiple repositories like:
* https://github.com/openebs/openebs/tree/master/k8s
* https://github.com/openebs/charts/tree/gh-pages/grafana-charts
