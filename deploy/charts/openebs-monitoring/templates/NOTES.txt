OpenEBS monitoring has been installed.
Check its status by running:
$ kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Use `kubectl get svc -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}` to list all the 
services in the `{{ .Release.Namespace }}` namespace.

To see the dashboards in grafana UI, create either a NodePort service for 
Grafana(grafana running on port 3000) and access it using that Node's IP 
or you can port-forward the traffic to Grafana pods to your host and 
access it via Host's IP
